# Scientific-Calculator

## Description
<B>This project is a scientific calculator built using React. The
calculator include all basic arithmetic operations, advanced functions like trigonometry,
logarithms, exponents, and special functions (e.g., factorial, random number). Added a history feature where users can see their past calculations. The calculator is designed to provide a user-friendly interface with accurate computations. </B>
